  </ul>

  <h2>How does Ferber sleep training work?</h2>
  <p>Ferber sleep training helps babies learn to self-soothe and sleep independently by gradually increasing the time parents wait before comforting them when they cry.</p>

  <h2>Key Steps:</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Prepare for Sleep</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow a consistent bedtime routine (e.g., feeding, bath, lullaby).</li>
    <li>Put your baby down in their crib drowsy but awake.</li>
    <li>Say goodnight and leave the room.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>2. Wait Before Checking In</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If your baby cries, wait a set amount of time before checking in.</li>
    <li>These wait times increase after each check-in (e.g., 1 min, 3 min, 5 min).</li>
    <li>This gradual approach helps your baby build confidence in falling asleep on their own.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>3. Keep Check-ins Brief and Calm</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Offer brief comfort with your voice or a gentle pat, but avoid picking up your baby.</li>
    <li>Keep it short (less than a minute), then leave the room again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>4. Repeat Throughout the Night</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Repeat the wait and check-in steps until your baby falls asleep.</li>
    <li>If your baby wakes during the night, start again from the first wait interval.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>5. Increase Wait Times Night by Night</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each night, the initial wait intervals get slightly longer (e.g., 3 min, 5 min, 10 min).</li>
    <li>This helps your baby gradually learn to fall asleep on their own.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>6. Stay Consistent</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most babies adjust in 3 to 7 nights. Staying consistent is key for steady progress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How does this app work with other sleep training courses or methods?</h2>
  <p>Many popular sleep programs are based on Ferber with slight changes to timing or terminology. This app lets you customize wait intervals, check-in durations, and the schedule to match whichever plan you're following.</p>

  <h2>How should I set up my baby's sleep environment?</h2>
  <p>A calm, dark, and consistent environment helps your baby fall and stay asleep:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Darkness:</strong> Use blackout curtains to block light.</li>
    <li><strong>White noise:</strong> A sound machine can mask background noise.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool temperature:</strong> Aim for 68–72°F (20–22°C).</li>
    <li><strong>Safe crib:</strong> Firm mattress, fitted sheet, no extra items.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Use the same sleep space for naps and bedtime.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What are check-ins?</h2>
  <p>Check-ins are brief visits to reassure your baby. Keep them short (30 seconds to 2 minutes) and avoid stimulating your baby. Comfort with your voice or gentle touch without picking them up.</p>

  <h2>Why do wait times increase?</h2>
  <p>Increasing wait times give your baby more opportunity to self-soothe. Starting small and gradually building helps ease them into the routine.</p>

  <h2>When should I start sleep training?</h2>
  <p>Most babies are ready around 4 to 6 months. Talk to your pediatrician before starting. Your baby may be ready if they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No longer need night feedings (or are cleared to skip them).</li>
    <li>Are gaining weight and healthy.</li>
    <li>Can self-soothe a little (e.g., thumb-sucking, pacifier).</li>
    <li>Have started to show regular sleep patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How long does sleep training take?</h2>
  <p>Most babies show progress within 3–7 nights. Some may take up to 2 weeks. Stay consistent and don’t worry about minor setbacks.</p>

  <h2>What if my baby is sick?</h2>
  <p>Pause training if your baby is unwell. Comfort them fully, and resume when they’re healthy. You can restart gently and they'll likely remember the routine.</p>

  <h2>What do I do if I am traveling?</h2>
  <p>Travel can disrupt sleep, but here are some tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recreate the sleep space:</strong> Bring familiar items like a sound machine or sleep sack.</li>
    <li><strong>Stick to your routine:</strong> Use the same bedtime rituals and timing if possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay flexible:</strong> Do your best without stressing if things go off-schedule.</li>
    <li><strong>Reset quickly:</strong> Once back home, resume your regular plan right away.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What if sleep training isn't working?</h2>
  <p>Don’t panic — progress can vary. If you're stuck:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Check your schedule:</strong> Your baby might be overtired or not tired enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Mixed signals can confuse your baby.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust the plan:</strong> You can use shorter or slower intervals while staying true to the Ferber approach.</li>
    <li><strong>Pause if needed:</strong> If everyone is stressed, it’s okay to take a short break.</li>
    <li><strong>Get help:</strong> Consider reaching out to a sleep consultant or pediatrician.</li>
  </ul>
