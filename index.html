  <h1>Privacy Policy for Oona</h1>

  <p>Thank you for using Oona ("the App"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our App.</p>

  <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information. All data entered into the App remains solely on your device and is not accessible by us or any third parties.</p>

  <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>The App uses SQLite, a local database stored on your device, to save sleep training session information. This data is not uploaded, shared, or accessible outside of your device.</p>

  <h2>3. No Internet Connection Required</h2>
  <p>Our App operates entirely offline, meaning it does not require an internet connection to function. There is no cloud storage, remote database, or external server involved.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We do not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The App does not use cookies, collect location data, or share any information with external parties.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Control Over Data</h2>
  <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. If you wish to delete your data, you can do so by uninstalling the App, which will remove all stored information.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the App Store listing and within the App itself.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the App Store listing.</p>

  <p>By using Oona, you acknowledge that your data remains on your device and is not collected or shared by us.</p>
